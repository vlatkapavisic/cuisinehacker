  review: Healthy food that tastes good. The prices are reasonable, and lower if you take the food a emporter. Apart from tasty nutrients, a guest can getinformed on the current fashion trends because of the chic clientele.

  review: Cold-pressed juices and vegan salads aren't the first association of Parisian food. But in the last couple of years, a lot of "healthy spots" have opened, offering a different approach to the famous French food hedonism.
